Simple version of safer string library

It should support
sscpy() to replace strcpy()
sscat() to replace strcat()
ssfgets() to replace fgets()
----
ssdup() corresponds to strdup()

Technique: using an adjacent header to provide size information

Branch
==========
Master branch only has clean code from the best branch.

simple_double_linked_list:
  use a signature mark, unsafe but fast verification

simple_list:
  a simple linked list, safe but slow verification

hash:
  hash table version, resizing makes items jumping around.


Usage Note
==========
Array, char s[], or an unintialized pointer, char *s, shouldn't
be pass to an argument supposed to be a managed string

Chain rule cannot be used, like
  sscat(sscpy(s, t), r);
sscat/sscpy are macros, they ask for s's address.

Use add2zcom.py to integrate the latest version into zcom.c


CHANGELOG
==========
Aug. 27, 2010  Tentatively rename ssnew to ssdup
  ssnew(n) now accept a number for buffer size
