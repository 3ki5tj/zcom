barm.c:   two replicas, using bennett's acceptance ratio to estimate
sqmcm.c:  single copy estimate
barm2.c:  (old) matching two Lennard-Jones systems, with different cutoff
lnzm.c:   (old) Z-algorithm style estimate of lnz

sqmc.c:   square-well temperature
sqmc1.c:  (old) square-well temperature profile

ljvol.c:  perturbation pressure
ljvol2.c: (old) perturbation pressure from observing the trajectory (bad idea)
          may be modified to the pressure profile later
rpt2.h:   used by ljvol.c

vx.py:   correction script for the output of isent.c
vs.py:   a slightly different script
