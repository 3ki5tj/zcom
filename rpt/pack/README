A self-contained package for the perturbation temperature.

FILES
======
ljmc.c          code for Metropolis algorithm (Monte Carlo) on a Lennard-Jones fluid
ljmd.c          code for molecular dynamics on a Lennard-Jones fluid
sqmc.c          code for Metropolis algorithm on a square-well fluid
is.c            code for Ising model
isent.c         code for Ising model, entropic sampling
zcom.h          common modules (abridged, the ZCOM_RPT portion is the code for the perturbation temperature)
is2dos0.ma      Mathematica script to compute the exact density of states of 2D Ising model
islogdos*.txt   pre-computed density of states for 2D Ising model
Makefile        build file
README          this file

Compile
=======
To compile: enter 
    make 
under Linux, or under windows (assuming visual C++)
    cl ljmc.c
    cl ljmd.c
    cl sqmc.c
    cl is.c
    cl isent.c

Run
====
To run a program (e.g., ljmc):
  ./ljmc
or (under windows)
  ljmc


Reading data
============
Output data are saved to ds.dat (reference sample) and dsb.dat (test sample), no matter what the program is.
Data are organized in columns, and can be plotted using gnuplot.
For example, to plot the resulting distributions from the test and reference samples

  gnuplot
  gnuplot> plot "dsb.dat" u 1:6 w l, "ds.dat" u 1:6 w l


Notes
======
We have adjusted the parameters, so each program can run quickly.
For actual production runs, increase simulation length and adjust other parameters.
