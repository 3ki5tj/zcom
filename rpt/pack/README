A self-contained package for the perturbation temperature.

FILES
======
ljmc.c          code for Metropolis algorithm (Monte Carlo) on a Lennard-Jones fluid
ljmd.c          code for molecular dynamics on a Lennard-Jones fluid
sqmc.c          code for Metropolis algorithm on a square-well fluid
is.c            code for Ising model
isent.c         code for Ising model, entropic sampling
barm.c          code for matching a square-well system to an LJ system
zcom.h          common modules (abridged, the ZCOM_RPT portion is the code for the perturbation temperature)
is2dos0.ma      Mathematica script to compute the exact density of states of 2D Ising model
islogdos*.txt   pre-computed density of states for 2D Ising model
Makefile        build file
README          this file

Compile
=======
To compile: enter 
    make 
under Linux, or under windows (assuming visual C++)
    cl ljmc.c
    cl ljmd.c
    cl sqmc.c
    cl is.c
    cl isent.c
    cl barm.c

Run
====
To run a program (e.g., ljmc):
  ./ljmc
or (under windows)
  ljmc

For advanced options, type 
  ljmc -h
for usage.


Reading data
============
Output data are saved to .dat formulas
Data are organized in columns, and can be plotted using gnuplot.


Notes
======
We have adjusted the parameters, so each program can run quickly.
For actual production runs, increase simulation length and adjust other parameters.
