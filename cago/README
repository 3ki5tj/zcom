Overview
=========
This is a module for C-alpha Go model.

Usage
=======

Example through zcom.h
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A basic MD example, which uses this module through zcom.h is:
  examle/go.c
Go to the `example' directory, type `make', and play with it.

Several example test code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
testannl.c   annealing program using basic functions
testmd.c     regular MD: cago_mdrun()
testucvg.c   U-convergent MD: cago_ucvgmdrun()
testrcvg.c   RMSD-convergent MD: cago_rcvgmdrun()

Notes:
~~~~~~


Code
=============

cago_t;
  Object of C-alpha Go model
 

Functions:

  cago_open(fnpdb, kb, ka, ..., rcc)
      Open the structure from a .pdb file
      Define contacts by calling pdbm_contact
      The contact matrix is saved in `go->iscont'
      The default cutoff rcc 4.5~5A in cago_open() gives 
        consistent contacts to the CSU data.
      Double-peak distributions are observed in 1KIK with rcc = 4.5A
      For 1VII (36-aa villin headpiece), the critical rcc
        should be larger 6.5A, may be because the structure not as tight.


  cago_close()


  The following are MD/MC functions
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  cago_initmd()
      initialize a structure either random (open chain)
      or somewhere close the to the native

  cago_vv()
      velocity verlet

  cago_vrescale()
      velocity rescaling

  cago_metro()
      Metropolis algorithm

  cago_writepos()/cago_writepdb()
      write position

  rmsd = cago_rmsd(go, x, NULL);

  ncontact = cago_countcontact(go, x);
