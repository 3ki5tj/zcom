Overview
=========
This is a module for C-alpha Go model.
The key reference is

Usage
=======

Example through zcom.h
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A basic MD example, which uses this module through zcom.h is:
  examle/go.c
Go to the `example' directory, type `make', and play with it.

Several example test code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
testannl.c   annealing program using basic functions
testmd.c     regular MD: cago_mdrun()
testucvg.c   U-convergent MD: cago_ucvgmdrun()
testrcvg.c   RMSD-convergent MD: cago_rcvgmdrun()

Notes:
~~~~~~


Code
=============

cago_t;
  Object of C-alpha Go model
 

Functions:

  cago_open(fnpdb, kb, ka, ..., rcc)
      Open the structure from a .pdb file
      Define contacts by calling pdbm_contact
      The contact matrix is saved in `go->iscont'
      The default cutoff rcc 4.5~5A in cago_open() gives 
        consistent contacts to the CSU data.
      Double-peak distributions are observed in 1KIK with rcc = 4.5A (T ~ 1)
      For 1VII (36-aa villin headpiece), however, the critical rcc
        should be larger then 6.5A, may be because the structure not as tight.


  cago_close()


  The following are MD/MC functions
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  cago_initmd()
      initialize a structure either random (open chain)
      or somewhere close the to the native

  cago_vv()
      velocity verlet

  cago_vrescale()
      velocity rescaling

  cago_metro()
      Metropolis algorithm

  cago_writepos()/cago_writepdb()
      write position

  rmsd = cago_rmsd(go, x, NULL);

  ncontact = cago_countcontact(go, x);



Reference data
==================

Below we list the transition temperature (where the folded and unfolded 
  peaks are of equal heights) of a few proteins

Generally with `rcc' increases, Tc also increases,
  for it's harder to melt down the structure

              rcc   ncont     Tc                   Comment
              3.5     64      (0.65, 0.7)         double peak 
1KIK (57aa)   4.5    132      1.07 (1.05, 1.1)    double peak
         
1VII (36aa)   6.5     50      1.25                verge of a double-peak feature

4MBN (153aa)  5.0    364      1.2 (1, 1.4)        double peak
