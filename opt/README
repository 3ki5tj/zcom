Option Object
==============

Overview
---------
 *  This is shared by cfg and argopt



Usage
------

To register (no actual computation) an option, use

  opt_set(o, sflag, key, fmt, ptr, desc);

for a configuration file entry,
    set `key' as in `key = val', set `sflag = NULL'
for a command-line option,
    set `sflag' such as `-v', `--file', set `key = NULL'
`fmt' is a sscanf() formatting string
    `fmt[0]' may be `!' to denote a mandatory entry
    "%b" is used for a switch
    NULL or "%s" are used for string
`ptr' is the pointer the variable for storage:
    if fmt == "%d", ptr should be `&ival'
    if fmt == "%s" or NULL, ptr should be a pointer to a pointer to char
    in the former case, `*ptr' will be allocated by sscpy()
       so a call ssdel(*ptr) should be used in the end
    in the latter case, `*ptr' is directed assigned to `o->val'

Once `o->val' is set, the particular value in `o->ptr'
can be retrieved by calling

  opt_getval(o)
