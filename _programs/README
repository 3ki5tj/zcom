Although this project is mainly a library, it has several useful programs

assemble.py                 assemble `zcom.h' from individual modules,
                            for internal use only
zcompick.py                 make `zcom.h' smaller by selecting only a few modules
                            independent of `assemble.py'
abpro/abemin.c              energy minimization program for AB protein model
cspacer/cspacer.py          add spaces to C code
cspacer/rstrip.py           (recursively) remove trailing white spaces
og/og.py                    object code generator
pdb/pdbalign/pdbalign.c     align two pdb structures
