Common code

Individual module should have their separate directories, except
  zcom.h, which is a combination of all frequently used ones.

Code should be concise and limited in size, 
  module names should be short.

Try to use symbolic links to files in this folder if possible, 
  otherwise try to use rsync to other locations

ss:             safe string
str:            utilities for string, compare, convert, strip
rng:            random number generator
cfg:            configuration file
dihcalc:        calculate dihedral
endian:         write with endian
lu:             LU decomposition
svd:            singular value decomposition
log:            log file
zt:             Z-algorithm related
trace:          write trace
hist:           collect and write simple histogram 
bio:            macros for read/write binary files
is2:            two dimensional ising model
util:           useful but unclassified routines
pdb:            read pdb
savgol:         compute Savitzky-Golay coeffcients
specfunc:       special functions

zcom.h:         a combination of useful routines
zcom.0.h:       template that creates zcom.h
add2host.py     add modules to zcom.h using the template zcom.0.h
                useful ./add2host.py -a

modules with a leading underscore are experimental, and not added to zcom.h

Notes:
Try to apply cspacer.py under ~/app/bin to check the source here from time to time

zcom.h should not have a routine like zcom_finish()
  because in case of multiple inclusion, zcom_finish is defined in the first instance,
  it has no knowledge of modules included later.
