Overview
---------

This project collects commonly used into a single header file zcom.h.

Individual module should have their separate directories, except
  zcom.h, which is a combination of all frequently used ones.

Code should be concise and limited in size,
  module names should be short.

Use symbolic links to define inter-modular dependence,
Use `_' to define the preceding module.


Files
------
zcom.0.h:       template that creates zcom.h
zcom.h          generated from zcom.0.h, combined header, by assemble.py
assemble.py     the python script that assembles modules to a single header
                ./assemble.py -a
Makefile        Makefile for common tasks, such as `usb', `usball', etc
gen.mak         generic Makefile to be used for new modules
license.txt     GPL less license, version 2
zcompick.py     end-user tool to remove certain modules from zcom.h



Directories
-----------
python          helper python scripts, such as add2d.py, rmdbg.py
programs        although the project is mainly a library, several useful programs
                are collected `programs' directory
cspacer.py      code beautifiers: cspacer.py, rstrip.py

cago:           C-alpha Go model
--
glez:           common uses for GLUT

modules with a leading underscore are experimental, and not added to zcom.h


Notes:
-------
* Try to apply cspacer.py/reindent.py under cspacer to check the source here from time to time

* zcom.h should not have a routine like zcom_finish()
  because in case of multiple inclusion, zcom_finish is defined in the first instance,
  it has no knowledge of modules included later.



TOOLS:
-------
Makefile
  common tasks
  make: call assemble.py to assemble zcom.h from modules
  make zcom.zip: make a package

assemble.py -a
  assemble zcom.h from modules

zcompick.py
  client tool to extract a few modules from zcom.h to a smaller version
