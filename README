Common code

Individual module should have their separate directories, except
  zcom.h, which is a combination of all frequently used ones.

Code should be concise and limited in size, 
  module names should be short.

Try to use symbolic links to files in this folder if possible, 
  otherwise try to use rsync to other locations

def:            definition of real and M_PI
util:           useful but unclassified routines
ss:             smart string
endn:           handle endianness
bio:            macros for read/write binary files
rng:            random number generator
rv2:            real [2] vectors and 2x2 matrices
rv3:            real [3] vectors and 3x3 matrices
eig:            eigenvalues and eigenvectors
lu:             LU decomposition
svd:            single value decomposion
rotfit:         fit two structures via rotation and translation
savgol:         compute Savitzky-Golay coeffcients
specfunc:       special functions
cfg:            configuration file
log:            log file
av:             simple mean/deviation
hist:           collect and write simple histograms (1d/2d)
mds:            multidimensional scaling
pdb:            read/write pdb
clus:           a Monte Carlo based clustering
md:             common molecular dynamics routines
wl:             Wang-Laudau related
tmh:            tempering with modified Hamiltonian
ising2:         two dimensional ising model
potts2:         two dimensional potts model
lj:             Lennard Jones liquid
abpro:          AB beads protein model
cago:           C-alpha Go model
--
glez:           common uses for GLUT

zcom.h:         a combination of useful routines
zcom.0.h:       template that creates zcom.h
add2host.py     add modules to zcom.h using the template zcom.0.h
                useful ./add2host.py -a

modules with a leading underscore are experimental, and not added to zcom.h

Notes:
Try to apply cspacer.py under ~/app/bin to check the source here from time to time

zcom.h should not have a routine like zcom_finish()
  because in case of multiple inclusion, zcom_finish is defined in the first instance,
  it has no knowledge of modules included later.

TOOLS:
Makefile
  common tasks
  make: call assemble.py to assemble zcom.h from modules
  make zcom.zip: make a package

assemble.py -a 
  assemble zcom.h from modules

zcompick.py
  client tool to extract a few modules from zcom.h to a smaller version
