Common code

Individual module should have their separate directories, except
  zcom.h, which is a combination of all frequently used ones.

Code should be concise and limited in size, 
  If possible, make them includable.
  File names should be short.

Try to use symbolic links to files in this folder if possible, 
  otherwise try to use rsync to other locations

ss:             safe string
rng:            random number generator
cfg:            configuration file
is2:            two dimensional ising model

zcom.h:         a combination of useful routines
zcom.h.0:       template that creates zcom.h
add2host.py     add modules to zcom.h using the template zcom.h.0
          

Notes:
zcom.h should not have a routine like zcom_finish()
  because in case of multiple inclusion, zcom_finish is defined in the first instance,
  it has no knowledge of modules included later.
