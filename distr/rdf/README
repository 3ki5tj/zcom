use the integral identity method to estimate a radial distribution function

to reproduce demonstration data, change active = 1 in run.py and type
  ./run.py
or
  make run

running the simulation should take 8 to 9 hours.

NOTES:
1. mean force variance appeared to be a constant of the distance r
   varmf = 100/tp
