use the integral identity method to estimate a volume distribution

to reproduce demonstration data, change active = 1 in run.py and type
  ./run.py
or
  make run

One should pay attention to the idea of differential volume distribution.
Thus at the end of the simulation, one must do a reweighting procedure
to get the actual the volume distribution.
Although the difference is usually small for a large system
