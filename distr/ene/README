use the integral identity method to estimate an energy distribution

to reproduce demonstration data, modify run.py such that active = 1,
and then type
  ./run.py
or
  make run
Note all .dat and .cfg files under data can be regenerated this way (except the link to eh.gp)

.dat and .cfg files

Naming convention
