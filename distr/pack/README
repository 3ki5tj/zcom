A self-contained package for estimating distribution using an integral identity.

FILES
======
ene.c           code for the energy distribution
ene.cfg         typical configuration file for the energy distribution
vol.c           code for the volume distribution
vol.cfg         typical configuration file for the volume distribution
rdf.c           main source code for the RDF
rdf.cfg         typical configuration file for the RDF
zcom.h          common modules (abridged, the ZCOM_DISTR portion is the code for the integral identity)
Makefile        build file
README          this file

Compile
=======
To compile: enter 
    make 
under Linux, or under windows (assuming visual C++)
    cl ene.c
    cl vol.c
    cl rdf.c

Run
====
To run (use rdf for example):
first edit `rdf.cfg' for parameters, then type (under Linux)
  ./rdf 
or (under windows)
  rdf


Reading data
============
Output data are saved to ds.dat (reference sample) and dsb.dat (test sample), no matter what the program is.
Data are organized in columns, and can be plotted using gnuplot.
For example, to plot the resulting distributions from the test and reference samples

  gnuplot
  gnuplot> plot "dsb.dat" u 1:6 w l, "ds.dat" u 1:6 w l


Notes
======
We have adjusted the parameters, so each program can run quickly (within two minutes on the test machine).
For actual production runs, increase simulation length and adjust other parameters.
