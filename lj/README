2D/3D Lennard Jones system

test1.c is somehow slower than ../md/testlj.c
because the array were allocated on the heap instead of the stack

test2.c is a better illustration
Using -DSTACK
          icc -O3     gcc -O3 -mfpmath=sse -march=pentium4 -fstrict-aliasing -funroll-all-loops -lm
 (HEAP)   14.6s       15.5s
-DSTACK   12.0s       12.8s

The speed up of using a stack is > 10%.

Interestingly, swapping xnew(x) and xnew(f) alleviates the problem
