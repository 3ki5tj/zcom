also support
Square-well potential with the special of a hard-sphere potential
Switched potential

test programs
===============
testmc.c    Monte Carlo simulation
testmd.c    molecular dynamics with thermostat and barostat
testctr.c   prototype of the perturbation temperature
testref.c   reference equation of states
testsw.c    print out the switch potential

ljmatch/ljmatch.c stillborn

Speed test
==========
testmd.c is somehow slower than ../md/testlj.c
because the array were allocated on the heap instead of the stack

test2.c is a better illustration
Using -DSTACK
          icc -O3     gcc -O3 -mfpmath=sse -march=pentium4 -fstrict-aliasing -funroll-all-loops -lm
 (HEAP)   14.6s       15.5s
-DSTACK   12.0s       12.8s

The speed up of using a stack is > 10%.

Interestingly, swapping xnew(x) and xnew(f) alleviates the problem
